 # QSYS_SIMDIR is used in the Quartus-generated IP simulation script to
 # construct paths to the files required to simulate the IP in your Quartus
 # project. By default, the IP script assumes that you are launching the
 # simulator from the IP script location. If launching from another
 # location, set QSYS_SIMDIR to the output directory you specified when you
 # generated the IP script, relative to the directory from which you launch
 # the simulator.
